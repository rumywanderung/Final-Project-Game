# About
My final game project at Interface3.

A 3D computer game about a masquerade of monsters, a human monster-hunter hiding in their midst, and the monster detective who has to uncover the culprit before it's too late.

# Tutorial
Pretty simple: Press [E] to talk to characters, press [G] to grab objects.
Your character is the Monster Detective, and your goal is to talk to the guests, collect clues, and report to Satan at the end of your investigation.
[HINT] Satan will arrive once you have the 3 clues.
[HINT] you can walk through walls and objects so it's easy to speedrun if you encounter a bug or make a bad pick.
